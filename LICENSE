--------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Our product makes use of the NCBI source code, and we did changes
   and additions to that version of the NCBI code to better fit it to
   our needs. Can we copyright the code, and how?

A. You can copyright only the *changes* or the *additions* you made to the
   NCBI source code. You should identify unambiguously those sections of
   the code that were modified, e.g. by commenting any changes you made
   in the code you distribute. Therefore, your license has to make clear
   to users that your product is a combination of code that is public domain
   within the U.S. (but may be subject to copyright by the U.S. in foreign
   countries) and code that has been created or modified by you.


--------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can we (re)license all or part of the NCBI source code?

A. No, you cannot license or relicense the source code written by NCBI
   since you cannot claim any copyright in the software that was developed
   at NCBI as a 'government work' and consequently is in the public domain
   within the U.S.


--------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What if these copyright guidelines are not clear enough or are not
   applicable to my particular case?

A. Contact us. Send your questions to 'toolbox@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov'.
